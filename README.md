# My Personal Notes for this project

uuid - I need the unique id which is uuid that will generate random IDs, for every specific room, I give unique id so
for example, if i join this zoom clone, i will get a unique id for me and i want to invite my friend through this room
but if somebody else create a new one they can join, i just need the unique one.

Socket io - It's for real time communication which is very famous for asynchronous real time communication. Web socket is like an internet
protocol but the difference is for example like what's the difference between sockets and http. For example: with http we can only make a 
request of the server but the server can only respond it cannot start the request to us. 

With Socket io, the server can commmunicate with us or we can communicate with them. With socket io the server doesn't have to wait for a request
for us to start a message or something. That's why socket io is good for real time. It creates a channel so only messages and traffic go through
that channel.  

WebRTC - open source project that provides web browsers and mobile applications with real-time communication via simple application 
programming interfaces

PeerJS - simplifies WebRTC peer-to-peer data, video and audio calls
